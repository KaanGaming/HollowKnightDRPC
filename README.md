# HollowKnightDRPC

Discord RPC mod for Hollow Knight.

Enables various stats such as Maximum Masks, Soul Vessels, Geo, and which room you are in.

Also supports Test of Teamwork mod!

It also provides 2 neat icons! Such as:

- **Large Image**: Which game mode you are in. Once hovered, shows the game mode itself and shows the version of the mod.
- **Small Image**: Neat little icon on which area you are in.

## Installation

1. Download the mod as usual.
2. Download Discord GameSDK into `C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Hollow Knight\hollow_knight_Data\Plugins`, by first getting the [Game SDK](https://dl-game-sdk.discordapp.net/2.5.6/discord_game_sdk.zip), then extract it and find the lib folder, copy both x86 and x86_64 folders into the Plugins folder.
3. You're ready to go! Unless you installed Discord, of course :P - I hope you know how to do that.

## Known Problems / FAQ

Q: It says "Failed to Load" at top left next to the mod!
A: You haven't installed Discord GameSDK yet. Follow the second step on Installation guide.

Q: When I check my Discord RPC, the room name shows a weird name!
A: Please report it to GitHub! I haven't added all room names yet (I think), so if you made an issue about it on GitHub, it would mean a lot!

Q: My game closes/restarts for some reason!
A: It may be because you don't have Discord installed, or you didn't open Discord yet. It will close itself, try to open Discord and retry to open the game. (check?)
